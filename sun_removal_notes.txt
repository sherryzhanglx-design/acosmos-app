Sun removal attempt 1:
- The solid orange fill of the sun was mostly removed
- But the outline/border of the sun circle remains (thin orange line)
- Some rays (small orange dashes) remain around the circle
- There's a remaining orange triangle near the neck/collar area
- Need to widen the color range to catch the lighter orange outlines and rays
- Also need to catch the remaining fill near the collar
