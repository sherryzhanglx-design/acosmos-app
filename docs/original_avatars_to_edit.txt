Original Avatars to Edit
========================

These are the original approved versions that need editing (NOT redesign):

1. anya_final.png - Hair bun, V-neck, calm expression
2. alma_final.png - Short pixie hair, hoop earrings, collar shirt, warm smile  
3. axel_final.png - Glasses, slicked-back gray hair, beard, open collar (has gray fills)

Required edits for all three:
- Thicken all lines (make bolder)
- Enlarge head portion
- Reduce/crop clothing portion
- Keep exact same character design

Note: Axel has gray fills on hair and beard - user previously wanted pure B&W but we should keep the design and just adjust proportions.
