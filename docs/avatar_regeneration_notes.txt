Avatar Regeneration Notes - January 27, 2026
============================================

CURRENT AVATARS REVIEWED:

1. ANDY (andy.png) - REFERENCE FOR SHOULDER STYLE
   - Wavy hair, glasses, polo shirt
   - Has full shoulder lines extending to both sides
   - Good amount of body/torso visible
   - This is the reference for how shoulders should look

2. ANYA (anya.png) - NEEDS MORE SHOULDER LINES
   - Hair in bun (black filled), V-neck top
   - Current issue: Only V-neck collar visible, no shoulder lines
   - User request: Add more shoulder lines on left and right sides
   - Keep: Hair bun, V-neck, calm expression, no glasses

3. ALMA (alma.png) - NEEDS SHOULDER LINES ADDED
   - Short pixie hair, hoop earrings, collared shirt
   - Current issue: Only collar visible, no shoulder lines
   - User request: Add shoulder lines (not just collar)
   - Keep: Short hair, hoop earrings, warm smile, collar

4. AXEL (axel.png) - NEEDS IMPROVED BEARD
   - Slicked-back gray hair (with gray fill), glasses, beard (gray fill)
   - Current issue: Beard looks odd/weird, gray fills
   - User request: Improve beard, make it look more natural
   - Need: Pure B&W line art, better beard design
   - Keep: Glasses, slicked-back hair, suit jacket

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Pure black line art on white background
- No gray fills or shading
- Shoulders should extend to sides like Andy's avatar
- Head positioned so hair is fully visible at top
