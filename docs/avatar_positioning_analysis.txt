Avatar Positioning Analysis - January 28, 2026
==============================================

Looking at the source images:

AXEL (reference - correct):
- Head positioned in upper-center of image
- Significant white space above head
- Minimal clothing visible (just collar/shoulders)
- Head fills about 60% of image height

ANDY (needs adjustment):
- Head positioned higher in image (less space above)
- More clothing/body visible (polo shirt with shoulders)
- Head fills about 45% of image height
- ISSUE: When cropped in circle, hair gets cut off

ANYA (needs adjustment):
- Head positioned higher in image (hair bun at very top)
- Less clothing visible but head still high
- Head fills about 55% of image height
- ISSUE: Hair bun gets cut off in circle

ALMA (needs adjustment):
- Head fills almost entire image (70%+)
- Very little space above head
- Minimal clothing visible
- ISSUE: Image is too zoomed in, feels cramped

SOLUTION:
The issue is that the source images have different compositions.
Rather than regenerating images, we can use CSS object-position 
to adjust how each image is displayed in the circular frame.

For Home.tsx and Chat.tsx:
- Andy: object-position center 30% (move down more)
- Anya: object-position center 25% (move down)
- Alma: reduce scale from 115% to 100% (zoom out)
- Axel: keep current settings (reference)
