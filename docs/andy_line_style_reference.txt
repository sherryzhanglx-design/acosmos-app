Andy Avatar Line Style Reference
=================================

Andy's avatar has the correct line thickness that displays well at small sizes.

Key characteristics:
- THICK, BOLD black outlines (approximately 2-3px stroke weight)
- Clean, confident strokes - not sketchy or thin
- Simple, minimal details - not overly detailed
- Strong contrast between black lines and white background
- Hair drawn with bold curved strokes, not fine wispy lines
- Glasses frames are thick and clearly visible
- Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) drawn with confident strokes
- Polo shirt collar clearly defined with bold lines
- Shoulders extend to edges with clear lines

The other avatars (Anya, Alma, Axel) need to match this BOLD line style.
Current issues: Lines are too thin, too detailed, appear faint/fuzzy at small sizes.
