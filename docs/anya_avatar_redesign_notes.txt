Anya Avatar Redesign Notes - January 28, 2026
==============================================

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Anya's current avatar only shows V-neck collar with minimal shoulder lines
- Shoulders and clothing are incomplete/cut off
- Face position needs to match Alma's positioning (face in center of circle)

REFERENCE - ALMA'S AVATAR (good example):
- Short pixie hair with texture lines
- Hoop earrings
- Warm friendly smile showing teeth
- Neck visible with collar/top of shirt showing
- Shoulder lines extend to edges of image
- Face is centered in the frame
- Bold, clear black lines

ANYA'S DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep: Black hair bun (solid black fill)
- Keep: V-neck top
- Keep: Calm, serene expression (slight smile, no teeth)
- Keep: East-West neutral appearance (not too Asian)
- ADD: Complete shoulder lines extending to left and right edges
- ADD: More of the V-neck top/chest area visible
- ADJUST: Face should be more centered (not too high in frame)
- STYLE: Bold black lines like Alma, not thin/faint lines

COMPOSITION:
- Head positioned so face is in center when placed in circular frame
- Hair bun at top with small space above
- Shoulders and upper chest visible at bottom
- Similar proportions to Alma's avatar
