Second attempt over-removed: the skin tone on the left side of the face was also removed because it overlaps with the sun color range. Need to use AI-based inpainting or a more targeted approach. The sun circle and rays outlines still partially remain. Best approach: use AI image editing to remove the sun and fill with background.
